# Python Data Structures â€“ LRU Cache & Custom HashMap

This repository features pure Python implementations of two essential data structures:

- **Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache**
- **Custom HashMap**

The goal is to achieve **O(1)** time complexity for key operations and demonstrate a solid understanding of core data structure and algorithmic principles in Python.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `lru_cache.py` â€“ Implements the LRU Cache with command-line interaction.
- `my_hashmap.py` â€“ Implements a simplified HashMap using separate chaining.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
python lru_cache.py
python my_hashmap.py
