# CacheAndMap-Implementations
This repository features pure Python implementations of two essential data structures: a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache and a custom HashMap. The primary objective is to achieve O(1) time complexity for core operations and showcase a deep understanding of algorithmic design and data structure fundamentals in Python.
